Building a technical blog or website of any kind poses many unique challenges, but there's nearly infinite ways to design a site; you can choose from many different content management frameworks and site generator tools. For me, I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator because of the many FOSS extensions and development flexibility, as well as the low-cost (often free, like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)) hosting ability of static websites. With this base framework, I found a couple great add-ons and tools that help to make a great blog for technical notes, especially when working with Machine Learning notebooks.
