## 3rd Party Libraries

User/3rd party made symbol libraries & footprints can be easily added to a KiCad project by going to the **Preferences** of the Symbol Editor and the Footprint Editor, then **Manage [Symbol|Footprint] Libraries...->Project Specific Libraries->Add existing library to table** (for more info see [Digi-Key's tutorial on importing libraries](https://forum.digikey.com/t/importing-the-digi-key-kicad-library-into-kicad-5-0-0/4075)).
