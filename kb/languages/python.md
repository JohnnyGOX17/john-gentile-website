## Language

Python is mainly split between the 2.X (older, now somewhat 'de facto' standard due to no more planned changes) and 3.X (the newer, forced Unicode generation of Python) and it's important to note where compatibility breaks between the two.

Pros of the language:
* _Quality:_ Python has been designed to be readable and very maintainable with a smaller size / less amount of code for similar functions in other languages like C++ or Java.
* _Portability:_ For the most part, Python can be run on all supported platforms (Windows, Mac & Linux) with little to no code modification.
* _Libraries & Components:_ Python is so widespread that there is a huge amount of libraries supporting a vast array of functionality that is easy to implement. Easy compnent integration also allows Python to be flexible enough in calling other code libraries or frameworks.

Cons:
* Really the main one is execution speed of Python's intermediate "byte code" versus a fully compiled language like C.
