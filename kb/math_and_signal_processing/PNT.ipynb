    "* [Signal Structure of the Starlink Ku-Band Downlink](https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/starlink_structure.pdf): Abstract—We develop a technique for blind signal identification of the Starlink downlink signal in the 10.7 to 12.7 GHz band and present a detailed picture of the signal’s structure. Importantly, the signal characterization offered herein includes the exact values of synchronization sequences embedded in the signal that can be exploited to produce pseudorange measurements. Such an understanding of the signal is essential to emerging efforts that seek to dual-purpose Starlink signals for positioning, navigation, and timing, despite their being designed solely for broadband Internet provision.\n",
