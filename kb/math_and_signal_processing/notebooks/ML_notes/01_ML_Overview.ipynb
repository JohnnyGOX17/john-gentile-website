    "Here the training dataset you feed the ML model includes the desired solutions/outcomes which are called _labels_. Some typical applications of Supervised Learning are:\n",
    "- **Classification:** many image classification tasks fit this model, such as a passing a training data set of different looks of images, each labeled by a specific _class_ (like \"cat\", \"dog\", \"giraffe\", etc.)\n",
    "- **Regression:** for example a model can be given a set of _features/attributes_ like mileage, age, brand, etc. (called _predictors_) to predict a _target_ car price. The label would still be the attributed price given a certain configuration of predictors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here the training dataset fed to the ML model is unlabeled, so the system must learn without an explicit \"teacher\". Some examples of unsupervised learning applications are:\n",
    "- **Clustering:** here the model will try and \"cluster\" or group data sets for you. If using a _hierarchical clustering_ algorithm, it also may subdivide each group into smaller groups.\n",
    "- **Visualization:** these algorithms are great for visualizing a 2D, or 3D, representation of your unlabeled dataset while maintaining clustering structure.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction:** here the goal is to simplify an input dataset without losing too much information by learning to merge correlated features into one, called _feature extraction_. Note that using this dimension reduction on very complex input training data is a great idea before feeding that dataset into another ML algorithm; the feature extraction can help to reduce the dataset size (e.g. to run faster) and may even improve performance of the ML algorithm.\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection:** for applications like fraud detection (or anything where we want to detect \"unusualness\" in a dataset), we show mostly \"normal\" instances during training so when a \"new instance\" is seen, it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or an anomaly.\n",
    "- **Association Rule Learning:** here the goal is for the algorithm to discover new/interesting relations between attributes in a dataset."

    "\n",
    "Labeling data can be a costly activity so some _semisupervised learning_ algorithms can deal with partially labeled datasets. Many are a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. For instance for Google Photos, you can upload a bunch of pictures and the unsupervised part of the system will cluster faces/people, and then when you label a person (technically the supervised part), it is able to use that label across any other photos it has clustered already; this is common for searching for people across unlabeled photos."

    "_Reinforcement Learning_ (RL) is very different compared to the (un)supervised learning methods; in this system, the learning model- called an _agent_- can observe the given environment, perform actions, and then get _rewards_ (positive reinforcement) or _penalties_ (negative reinforcement) in return. Based on the reinforcement, the system must then learn the best strategy to optimize positive rewards over time, called a _policy_; a policy is an action the agent should choose in a given situation.\n",
