## Continuous Improvement

[Day 1 vs Day 2 culture](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/):

- Continuous improvement is improvement done on all processes, every day; weekly projects does not constitute 
  for continuous improvement
  - there is no finish line and since the future is unclear, once should strive for many small, continuous steps
    towards success
    - Toyota considers the improvement capability of all the people in an
    organization the “strength” of a company.
    From this perspective, then, it is better for an organization’s adaptiveness, competitiveness, and survival to have a large group of people systematically, methodically, making many small steps of improvement every
    day rather than a small group doing periodic big projects and events.
    - leadership is key to have everyone, not just managers, care enough about overarching objectives to 
      continuously improve
      - prioritize problems and don't just fix them, understand why they happened in the first place
      Non-Toyota thinking: normal daily management
      improvement
      Toyota thinking: normal daily management process
      improvement
