* Simple, correct, fast; in that order.
* If your product is perfect, you've released too late. The first person to market can be twice the cost with half the capability, but the second person has to have twice the capability at half the cost to compete.
* Automate & script everything. Leave time for the important stuff.
* [Learning at work is work, and we must make space for it](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/learning-for-a-living/)
* Coders can get writer's block too, try stream-of-conciousness style writing to code development.
* Don't be afraid of failure.
* Open standards & reuse allow you to iterate faster with relatively less NRE.
* Marketing yourself and your product is extremely important, even more so within a large company to your peers & leaders; all the more reason to be a better speaker & writer. It often doesn't even matter if you're the best, think VHS vs Betamax.
* Move processing to data rather than moving data to processing
* Networking can come in the form of being apart of standards bodies (e.g. IEEE) or being a speaker at conferences.
