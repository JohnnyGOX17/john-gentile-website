* Simple, correct, fast; in that order.
* What gets measured gets improved. What gets scheduled gets done.
* Follow the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle); 80% of something can be developed in 20% of time. However conversely, the hardest 20% of the design takes 80% of the time (e.g. driving to perfection/shipping quality).
* If your product is perfect, you've released too late. The first person to market can be twice the cost with half the capability, but the second person has to have twice the capability at half the cost to compete.
* Automate & script everything. Leave time for the important stuff.
* [Learning at work is work, and we must make space for it](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/learning-for-a-living/)
* Coders can get writer's block too, try stream-of-conciousness style writing to code development.
* Don't be afraid of failure.
* Open standards & reuse allow you to iterate faster with relatively less NRE.
* Marketing yourself and your product is extremely important, even more so within a large company to your peers & leaders; all the more reason to be a better speaker & writer. It often doesn't even matter if you're the best, think VHS vs Betamax.
* Move processing to data rather than moving data to processing
* Networking can come in the form of being apart of standards bodies (e.g. IEEE) or being a speaker at conferences.


## Continuous Improvement

[Day 1 vs Day 2 culture](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/):

- Continuous improvement is improvement done on all processes, every day; weekly projects does not constitute 
  for continuous improvement
  - there is no finish line and since the future is unclear, once should strive for many small, continuous steps
    towards success
    - Toyota considers the improvement capability of all the people in an
    organization the “strength” of a company.
    From this perspective, then, it is better for an organization’s adaptiveness, competitiveness, and survival to have a large group of people systematically, methodically, making many small steps of improvement every
    day rather than a small group doing periodic big projects and events.
    - leadership is key to have everyone, not just managers, care enough about overarching objectives to 
      continuously improve
      - prioritize problems and don't just fix them, understand why they happened in the first place
      Non-Toyota thinking: normal daily management
      improvement
      Toyota thinking: normal daily management process
      improvement
