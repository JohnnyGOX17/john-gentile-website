- continuos improvement is improvement done on all processes, every day; weekly projects does not constitute 
  for continuous improvement
  - there is no finish line and since the future is unclear, once should strive for many small, continuous steps
    towards success
    - Toyota considers the improvement capability of all the people in an
    organization the “strength” of a company.
    From this perspective, then, it is better for an organization’s adaptiveness, competitiveness, and survival to have a large group of people systematically, methodically, making many small steps of improvement every
    day rather than a small group doing periodic big projects and events.
    - leadership is key to have everyone, not just managers, care enough about overarching objectives to 
      continuously improve
      - prioritize problems and don't just fix them, understand why they happened in the first place
      Non-Toyota thinking: normal daily management

“all people in the NFL are good and with QBs you’ll sometimes have QBs that stay great and you’ll often have that one QB that comes in and does really well his rookie year and then falls off the face of the earth (cause teams in the NFL learn what they’re doing and shut them down). The difference between those QBs and the ones that stay great is the drive to keep improving and to never stop growing.”
