you don't have to create something completely new but you should be the best and most differentiated company in that space

## Business Types

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Things that work well:
* Usage based licensing that scales easily from single users to small businesses to very large enterprise accounts. Partly the freemium model can fit here; free with basic features to drive adoption and then differentiated features at a price.
  + Pricing/Licensing that can vary with timelines as well is helpful (i.e. not everything should be bought or decided on a yearly basis)

## Tools

* [Mail Chimp](https://mailchimp.com/): email and marketing automation platform.
* [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/): Live chat platform for also catching, and tracking, leads.
