## Overview

First step is to create a plan and state financial goals you want. You also need to know that just saving and putting aside money is not enough; if money is being kept in checking or low-APY savings accounts (or cash stuffed under the bed...), you'll actually lose money in the long run due to inflation (which slowly devalues the dollar as time goes on). Historically, inflation rates have averaged ~3% per year; not a large number but over 20 years, this means prices about double. Thus even if someone wants to just save money, there exists a need to invest that money such that it at least bucks inflation.
