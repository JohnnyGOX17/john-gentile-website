    "A **chirp** is a signal where the frequency increases (_up-chirp_) or decreases (_down-chirp_) with time, (also known as a frequency sweep).\n",

    "\n",
    "In LFM chirp, the instantaneous frequency, $f(t)$ (in Hz), varies linearly with time:\n",
    "$$f(t) = ct + f_{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{0}$ is the starting frequency (Hz), and $c$ is the constant chirp rate given an end frequency $f_{1}$ (Hz) and the sweep time between frequencies $T$:\n",
    "$$c = \\frac{f_{1} - f_{0}}{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since [frequency is the derivative of phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantaneous_phase_and_frequency) (e.g. $\\omega(t) = \\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt}$), and frequency is linearly changing (increasing or decreasing), it is expected that phase changes _quadratic_ over time, as shown by:\n",
    "$$\\phi(t) = \\phi_{0} + 2\\pi \\int^{t}_{0}f(\\tau)d\\tau \\rightarrow \\phi_{0} + 2\\pi \\int^{t}_{0}(c\\tau + f_{0})d\\tau $$\n",
    "$$\\therefore \\phi(t) = \\phi_{0} + 2\\pi \\left( \\frac{c}{2}t^{2} + f_{0}t \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding time-domain output is simply the $\\sin()$ of this phase function, or $e^{j\\phi(t)}$ for complex output."
