1. Slice the roll in the middle, lengthwise, but not all the way through. Take some of the soft, inner bread out to make more room for the ingredients.
2. Spread mayo on one side of the bread, and then layer cheese, and then all meats evenly across the inside of the bread. At this point if you wanted a hot sub, you could bake in a 350 °F oven for 10-15 min (until cheese is melted and bread is toasted).
3. Add tomato & onion slices, pickles and pepper slices in even layers in the sub.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the lettuce, oregano, olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Then layer inside of sub.
