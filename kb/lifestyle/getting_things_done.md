## General Advice

* Control your controllables, and don't worry about things out of your control.
* [Always the hard way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGR0jtA6NXg). Embrace, and laugh, at the suck. Those who dare, win.
* The best way to complete a marathon is to take the first step. Activity defeats doubt.
* Happiness is a mindset, not an achievement or place.
* Time flies; the longer you push something off, the time it will take to complete will grow exponentially.
* Your tribe is your vibe. Growing a tribe is never bad but don't neglect your inner circle.
* Work on what you love and the money will come. Actually, if you really love it, the money won't matter as much anyways.
* Procrastination comes from not having a drive, which usually means you don't know why, or don't believe, in what you're doing. At the same time, motivation is temporary, dedication & discipline is the real test of lasting performance.
* Nothing's guaranteed in life and no one deserves anything, no matter how unfair things seem.
* Create your own luck; take lots of thoughtful shots over time, and keep working to improve.
* You can't do everything yourself; 10x'ers can be multipliers when they inspire and mentor others.
* What others see as impossible is possible with the right folks who believe in the mission.
* If it doesn't make you better, happier or richer, don't make time for it.
* Money can be used to buy back time, as time is often more valuable than money.
* Things that get measured get improved
* Praise in public, correct in private
* You can use anger to drive/motivate you in the short term, but be careful to not thrive on it as that turns you into a generally negative/angry person

### Waking Up Early

Before everyone else is up with distractions, set your day up for success and give yourself time to dedicate to things that are important to you:
* Set a time to wake up and consistently wake up at that time to set a habit
  + From this time, make sure to also set a bedtime to stick to to ensure you're getting enough sleep. Some people need at least 8 hours to be functional during the day, others as little as 5-6 hours; it all depends on the person and how they feel during the day. If you're used to being a night owl, you might have to progressively move your bedtime & wake-time up little-by-little to actually wake up in the morning as expected if there is a large delta between your current timing and your goals- for instance, moving your wake-up time up by 30min each day. As well, this may mean cutting back on late-night activities that you may be used to doing in order to fall asleep in time; also note that more and more studies are showing that excessive blue light- from TV, computer and phone screens- can prolong the body from effectively falling asleep.
* Create a plan for the morning on how exactly you'll use the free time. Make sure there is a clear explanation to "why?" you are waking up early and doing what you are doing- because you will inevitably ask yourself that question when trying to commit to this habit.
  + Make the very first task exciting so that you are motivated to wake up and complete it; for example, making coffee or some time to a favorite hobby. All other tasks that you are less excited about- like working out or starting work- can then come after once you're up. Otherwise, you're likely to stay in bed, unmotivated to instantly jump out of bed to do the tasks you aren't excited for.
* Keep clothes for the morning close by (e.x. workout clothes) and organized so it's that much easier to pop out of bed and be ready to go.
* Before going to bed, keep a full, cold glass of water by your alarm. If you aim to drink the whole glass as soon as you wake up, it serves as another boost to waking out of the groggy-ness of bed.
* If you're really having an issue with trying to wake up, try moving your alarm out of arms reach from where you sleep. If you have to actually get out of bed to stop your alarm, it not only will be much harder to inadvertently hit the "snooze" button, but you've already made the biggest step to waking up, getting your ass out of bed.
