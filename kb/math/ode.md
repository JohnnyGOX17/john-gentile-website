## Overview

Differential equations are important as many fields such as engineering, physics, science and others have phenomena that can best be described, modeled and solved via differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are differential equations that depend on a single variable. Complex differential equations dependent on multiple variables are [partial differential equations](pde).

## First-Order ODEs

The simplest ODEs are first-order because they only involve the first derivative of an unknown function and no higher derivatives; specific differential equations can generally be described of order _n_ where the _nth_ derivative of the unknown function is the highest derivative present. These unknown functions can be represented as $$ y(x) $$ or $$ y(t) $$ depending on the units in question.

Thus, a _first-order ODE_ usually takes the explicit form
\$\$ y{}'=f(x,y) $$

### Solutions

A function \$\$ y=h(x) $$

is a solution to an ODE on some
