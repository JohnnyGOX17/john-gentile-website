## Why Rust?

Rust is relatively young compared to other systems programming languages. However, it has taken many of the lessons learned from decades of other languages to form something that:
* Puts memory safety at the forefront
* Allows for similar speed and zero-cost abstractions as C++

### Why Not Rust?

Ignoring criticisms based on feelings and/or fanboy-isms, there has been some valid and well-researched opinions on where Rust may still fall short:

## Install and Getting Started

- [Installing Rust is fairly simple](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) using the rustup script: `$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
  + On macOS, make sure C compiler is installed with `$ xcode-select --install`
- Rust can be updated at any time with `$ rustup update`

## Tools

### Cargo

`cargo` is installed automatically with the typical install process.

- A new Rust project can be created by running `$ cargo new <project_name>` and, by default, creates a variety of helpful files:
  + Creates a `.gitignore` file and -if not already within a git repo- initializes a new Git repo
    * To not have a Git repo instantiated, pass `--vcs none`.
  + A [TOML](https://toml.io/) config file `Cargo.toml` that describes the metadata and dependencies of the Rust project.
  + A `src/` directory in which Rust source should live.
  + Add `--lib` to the end of `cargo new` to create a library (no binary compilation target).
- Use `$ cargo init --vcs none` if already in a directory (such as pulled from a fresh GitHub repo).
- When using a Cargo project, `$ cargo build` can be used
  + `$ cargo run` can be used to build and then execute in one command.
  + Or for a more straight forward approach, `$ rustc main.rs` compiles the Rust file `main.rs` into an executable file `main`.
- [johnthagen/min-sized-rust: ðŸ¦€ How to minimize Rust binary size ðŸ“¦](https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust)

For more info, [see The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html).

As part of `cargo` there's also:
- [clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/): a collection of lints to catch common mistakes and improve Rust code
- [rustfmt](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=master&search=): a Rust code formatter, can also be run with `cargo fmt`.

### rustdoc

Rust ships with a tool called [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) which can generate documentation by parsing specially formatted comments in Rust source code.

`rustdoc` can also perform [documentation tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html) within comments.

### Cross-Compile & FFI

* [dtolnay/cxx](cxx.rs): safe interop between Rust and C++.
* [google/autocxx: Tool for safe ergonomic Rust/C++ interop driven from existing C++ headers](https://github.com/google/autocxx)

### Other Tools

* [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/): implements Language Server Protocol (LSP) for Rust (allows IDEs/editors to have completion, definition, goto, etc. features).
* [cargo-audit](https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec/tree/main/cargo-audit): audits dependencies for crates with known security vulnerabilities, maintained by [RustSec Advisory Database](https://rustsec.org/).
  * [cargo-deny](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny): plugin for linting dependencies.
* [grcov](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov): collect & aggregate code coverage data for source files (also supports C/C++ projects, or files that can be processed by llvm/clang/gcc).
* [loom](https://github.com/tokio-rs/loom): concurrency permutation testing for parallel Rust code.
* [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri): interpreter for Rust's mid-level interpreter (MIR) and detect classes of undefined behavior.
* [cargo-show-asm](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-show-asm): a cargo subcommand that displays the Assembly, LLVM-IR, MIR and WASM generated for Rust source code.

### Async / Concurrent Rust

See [rust-async-framework](https://github.com/JohnnyGOX17/rust-async-framework) for more details and implementation examples.

#### Arc

For unmutable, shared references to data across threads, [`std::sync::Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html) provides an "Atomically reference counted" wrapper- once all threads are done with the Arc, its reference counter will drop to zero and the underlying structure will be dropped/deallocated.

```rust
let a = Arc::new([1, 2, 3]);

thread::spawn({
    let a = a.clone();
    move || {
        dbg!(a);
    }
});
```
