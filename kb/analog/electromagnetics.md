## Ideal Transmission Lines

### Telegrapher's Equations

The goal of the Telegrapher's Equations is to express complex electric and magnetic field behavior of transmission lines with simple equivalent circuits.



## TBD

* When an ideal driver transmits a voltage into a high-impedance (open) receiver
    - Almost all signal is reflected back creating a 2x driven amplitude (i.e. a 2.5Vpp driver will see a 5Vpp signal amplitude into an open receiver) on the line and, in the ideal case, the signal oscillates back and forth indefinitely
