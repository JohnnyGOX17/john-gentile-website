## Physics of Electrical Circuits

Fundamentally, there is the property of matter _Charge_ which is measured in Coulombs (C). Charge is directly related to one of the fundamental building blocks of matter, the electron; the charge of an electron (e) is negative and has a magnitude of ~1.602x10<sup>-19</sup>.

## Direct Current Circuit Analysis (DC)

## Alternating Current Circuit Analysis (AC)

Electromagnetic (EM) waves behave like all other waves:
* They can be continuous or happen in short bursts
* They propagate in some medium over time and attenuate as they propagate
* They can be absorbed or reflected
* Their paths can be guided


### Transmission Lines

#### Application Examples

* When an ideal driver transmits a voltage into a high-impedance (open) receiver
    - Almost all signal is reflected back creating a 2x driven amplitude (i.e. a 2.5Vpp driver will see a 5Vpp signal amplitude into an open receiver) on the line and, in the ideal case, the signal oscillates back and forth indefinitely
