In the beginning, software was run as hard coded instructions targeting a computer to run a single, finite task (hell it even used to be coded on physical punch cards). However, due to ever increasing demand for faster and more powerful systems, the antiquated systems of the past grew in the level of complexity, and corresponding resulting layers of abstraction, to the operating systems we have today. In general, a systems software van be grouped into two buckets:
* Operating System: program(s) that manage system resources, libraries and allow applications to easily run
* Applications: programs that run on top of an operating system and interact with the user to run a variety of tasks
