## Signals & Systems Overview

A **signal** is a pretty general term; it can describe a set of data pertaining to almost any sort of application or industry- from the electrical signal passing internet bits around to stock ticker prices driving world markets. **Systems** process signals by modifying, passing and/or extracting information from them.


$$ E_{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left | x(t) \right | ^{2} dt $$
