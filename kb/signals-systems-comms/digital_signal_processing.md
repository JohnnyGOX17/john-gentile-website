## Overview

**Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** provides a means for analyzing & constructing signals in the digital domain, often done in digital hardware or in software; as opposed to the analog domain, the continual progression of smaller and faster digital hardware allows for signal processing systems that are often cheaper, more reliable and even more adaptable than their hard-wired analog counterpart. Albeit practical, these benefits can sometimes come at the cost of precision due to the nature of converting between analog and digital domains. In practice though, intelligent application of DSP concepts can reduce these distortion effects, and in some cases, actually improve & condition the signal for an intended purpose.
