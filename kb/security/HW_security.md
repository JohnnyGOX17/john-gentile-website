## FPGA Security

### Configuration Scrubbing 

[Scrubbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scrubbing#FPGA) is the periodic reprogramming, or checking, of FPGA configuration space (e.g. how Programmable Logic fabric is programmed and routed) to prevent/fix errors. These errors could be caused by radiation (e.x. FPGAs operating in a space or nuclear environment) or malicious actors.
