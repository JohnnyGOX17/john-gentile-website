## Overview

For system and low-level programming, C has been the defacto standard, however it was built to have an abstract model representing a single processor with a single block of memory. Go was developed to fit the niche of low-level development of multiprocessor environments.

## Toolchains

* [Golint](https://github.com/golang/lint) is a linter for Go source code.
