Architectures and design patterns for systems that are data intensive, as well as distributed computing systems. For a great overview, and impetus for AWS, see [Amazon's Distributed Computing Manifesto](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html).

## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

* [public-apis/public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)
* [Ã˜MQ (ZeroMQ) - The Guide](https://zguide.zeromq.org/)

### Debug/Tools

`curl` can be used to debug REST APIs like:
* Displaying response and headers with `$ curl -v http://www.example.com/api/ping`
* PUT method with `$ curl -X PUT -d 'name=Sugar&category_id=3' http://www.example.com/api/products`
* Use authentication with a token like `$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer b1094abc0-54a4-3eab-7213-877142c33fh3" http://example.com/api/resource`
* Show the HTTP response code with `$ curl -I http://www.example.com/`
* And much, much more like in [everything curl](https://everything.curl.dev/)


## Virtualization and Containers

### Virtual Machines (VM)

* [Qemu](http://wiki.qemu-project.org/Main_Page)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox)

### Containers

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet)

#### Useful Docker Commands

* Restart last container created: `docker start $(docker ps -ql)`
  + Reattach terminal & stdin to last: `docker attach $(docker ps -ql)`
* List currently running Docker instances: `docker ps -a`
* Stop all containers: `docker kill $(docker ps -aq)`
* Delete all containers, including its volumes they use: `docker rm -vf $(docker ps -aq)`
* Delete all docker images: `docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)`
  + **NOTE:** you should remove all containers before removing all the images from which the containers were created.
* Delete _everything_ (removing all unused containers, volumes, networks, images, etc.) and reclaim disk space (essentially remove everything!), use: `docker system prune -a --volumes`

### Packet FEC in lieu of Retransmission

When latency is key (can't wait/block for packet loss) in lossy networks (e.x. WAN, intermittent links, etc.), Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques (similar to those used at the physical layer) can be applied at the network layer. For instance in [SD-WAN FEC](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/prisma-sd-wan-articles/prisma-sd-wan-forward-error-correction/ta-p/554608), lost packets can be recovered on a link by sending extra "parity" packets for every $N$ packets. See [more details on Information Theory](../math_and_signal_processing/info_theory.html).
