## Language

### Standard Structure

Starting with the ubiquitous "Hello, World" program in C:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}



## Building C Programs

### GNU cc (gcc)

`gcc` is a common compiler for the C language (as well as C++ and Objective C). Debug information and optimizations can also be utilized.
